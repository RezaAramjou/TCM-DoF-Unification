# TCM-DoF-Unification
Python MoM/CMA solver numerically validating the unification of antenna radiation theories. This project proves the one-to-one correspondence between internal Characteristic Modes (TCM) and the external radiated field's complexity , which defines an antenna's Degrees of Freedom (DoF).
